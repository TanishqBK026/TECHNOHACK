# NeedOrLend: A one stop solution to help make these services more accessible to the general public because you deserve it. 

For many people living with disabilities, physical care is often seen as the first priority, and yes ofcourse disability hardships are real, but they don’t have to be, and everyone can help reduce them by the way we treat these specially abled people and accommodate their impairments. Although as simple the solution might sound on paper, many of these specially abled people in modern India aren't quite treated right. Both treated as in dealt with, and treated as in given care. 
This is a major problem because realistically how much does an individual really knows about disability? If you’re not disabled yourself, and don’t have a child, spouse, brother or sister, or parent with disabilities, how knowledgeable and up to date on disability issues are you expected to be?
